# Array Binary Search
Write a function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

# Approach & Efficiency
I approached this by firstly analyzing the code and then by using the refrence in canvas.

It is effecient as it can find any index of provided value within an Sorted array by only doing 3 steps instead of looping over each and every element.
